This is the development site for the Skeptical Inquiry Network Inc., a registered non-profit organisation based in Eswatini. The founders are currently in the process of building the site, and once development is complete, it will be made private. In the meantime, if you're interested in contributing or supporting our efforts, please feel free to reach out.

Our main objective is to promote critical thinking, scientific skepticism, and rational inquiry within society. We aim to:

Encourage evidence-based thinking in addressing societal issues.
Advocate for the use of science and reason in public policy.
Challenge pseudoscience, superstition, and misinformation.
Support educational initiatives that enhance scientific literacy.
Build a community of skeptics and rational thinkers in Eswatini and beyond.
Foster open discussion and debate on controversial and misunderstood topics.
Provide a platform for public engagement in scientific skepticism.
Empower individuals to make informed decisions based on critical evaluation of evidence.
Collaborate with like-minded organisations for greater societal impact.
Promote the separation of religious ideologies from scientific and educational institutions.
